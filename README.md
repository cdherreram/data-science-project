# Write a Data Science Blog - Udacity Course

This project shows some results about the Boston and Seattle Airbnb datasets in 2016 in a Python project throught a Jupyter Notebook. The main objective is to prepare, analyze and use data science and ML tools in a database and present these results in a technical and non-technical language. Specifically, this project had as a goal to review information about listings and reviews for information in Seattle and Boston and answer some questions about this data. Some of these questions are answered in the notebook and blog.

In this project was used Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical results and Scikit learn for ML models (LinearRegression and DecisionTreeRegressor). Pandas is the usual tool in tables.

The associated files in this project are:
- A Jupyter Notebook with all analized results with technical issues.
- A associated [blog](https://medium.com/@cdherreram/what-is-the-best-price-for-my-place-in-airbnb-34475d5419a7) to this analysis.

## Installation:
- Numpy: For use of arrays in Python
- Pandas: Library for data science analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For graphical analysis
- Scikit-learn: Library to develop ML models.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with all code to analyze the Airbnb data. For the .csv files, you can find all [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) for Seattle and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston/data) for Boston data.

## Some results

In the project, I found some results about the common amenities including wireless internet, heating and smoke detectors. In terms of score rating, Seattle has some higher scores in their listings. And finally, in the models, I discovered how linear models can be poor to explain the data, and how decision tree model (and possibly other non-linear models) can achieve a better result in predicting the price.

## Acknowledgments
I want to thank Udacity for the activity and lessons to contribute in my career as a Data Scientist and Airbnb for provide the data to this project.
