# Write a Data Science Blog - Udacity Course

This project shows some results about the Boston and Seattle Airbnb datasets in 2008 in a Python project throught a Jupyter Notebook. The main objective is to prepare, analyze and use data science and ML tools in a database and present these results in a technical and non-technical language. Specifically, this project had as a goal to review information about listings and reviews for information in Seattle and Boston and answer some questions about this data. Some of these questions are answered in the notebook and blog.

In this project was used Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical results and Scikit learn for ML models (LinearRegression and DecisionTreeRegressor). Pandas is the usual tool in tables.

The associated files in this project are:
- A Jupyter Notebook with all analized results with technical issues.
- A associated [blog](https://www.google.com.co) to this analysis.
